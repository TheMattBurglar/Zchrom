This is a little CLI program to test what would happen if we added a Z chromosome that made a person Female, regardless of their other chromosome. ex: a ZY Female

I’m not a professional programmer, and I didn’t use AI to put this together in any way.

I originally threw this together many years ago in python (well before AI assisted programming was a thing), but it was slow, and a bit of a spaghetti mess, despite its small size.  I rewrote it in Go to both speed it up and clean it up.

I used this CLI program to figure out the rough demographic makeup of a Sci-Fi/Fantasy story I was writing at the time.  Having finished the beginnings of that story, I now consider this program complete.  Don’t expect many (or any) updates.

That said, I still find it fun to play with once in a while.  I enjoy setting things up such that the low birthrate causes the population to shrink, until the increased number of women make up for the low birth rate, and the overall population starts growing again.

If you want to play with this too, you’ll have to compile the source code.  Don’t worry, you can figure it out!  It’s just Go!
